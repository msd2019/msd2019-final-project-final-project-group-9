# Analyzing the mobility of prestige for different ranks

Below are density plots of prestige change for top15 and rest while splitting by both department and rank. Plots look pretty chaotic and we should probably bet rid of these eventually, but it doesn't hurt to see how small the differences are between the splits. 

```{R}

top15 %>%
  mutate(rankdep = paste(rank, dep)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = diff, color = rankdep) ) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed' ) +
  ylim(0, 2.8) + 
  xlim(-.5, 1) +
  ggtitle("Top 15% of Institutions") + 
  ylab('Density') +
  xlab('Relative change in rank from Ph.D Institution') +
  labs(color = 'Department')


rest %>%
  mutate(rankdep = paste(rank, dep)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = diff, color = rankdep) ) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed' ) +
  ylim(0, 2.8) + 
  xlim(-.5, 1) +
  ggtitle("All other Institutions") + 
  ylab('Density') +
  xlab('Relative change in rank from Ph.D Institution') +
  labs(color = 'Rank and Department')


```




Here is a plot of change in prestige density for the all the data, looking at splits by faculty rank.  
Can see a slightly larger portion of "full" faculy staying within their Ph.d institution's rank. Slightly more mobility fopr Assoc and Asst, but not by much. 

```{r}

rbind(top15, rest)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = diff, color = rank) ) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed' ) +
  ylim(0, 2.8) + 
  xlim(-.5, 1) +
  ggtitle("All Institutions") + 
  ylab('Density') +
  xlab('Relative change in rank from Ph.D Institution') +
  labs(color = 'Rank')

```

  select(v, u,  institution) %>%
